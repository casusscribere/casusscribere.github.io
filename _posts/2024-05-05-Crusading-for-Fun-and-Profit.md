### An Examination of Ludohistorical Mode in the Crusader Kings Community
My dissertation revisits core questions and anxieties regarding the relationship between history and play in digital media; it expands the scope of consideration to include the broader assemblage surrounding play, with specific attention paid to the roles played by platforms, paratexts, and formal affordances on the co-construction of play and reception culture within one particular community of practice--the <i>Crusader Kings III</i> community. This work has also been published in the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) and Digital Games Research Assocation (DiGRA) conferences.
